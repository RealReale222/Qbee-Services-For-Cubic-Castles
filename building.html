      <h2>Extra Info</h2>
      <p>We may not be able to do extremely complicated builds, due to limited materials and time. If you want a more simple build done like a crafting room or a simple 2D logo, that's more the type of thing we do.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="themes">
      <h2>Themes</h2>
      <p>Themes are 2-5 different colors or types of blocks that will be used in your build. Example; New Wood and Old Wood blocks. Add RealReale222 to view these themes, or ask to make a custom one.</p>

    <section id="pricing">
