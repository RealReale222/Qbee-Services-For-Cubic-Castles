      <h2>Extra Info</h2>
      <p>
        The easiest way to level up your pet is to let someone else do it! Once we're finished leveling it, you can have a leveled pet, easy and cheap! This can take anywhere from 2 days to 1 month depending on the amount of time we can spend on it per day and how many levels you want. If you want a time estimate, add RealReale222 in-game and she can tell you how long it will take if you provide the amount of levels you need and when you need it done (we won't be able to level your pet as fast if you need it done close to a holiday).
